# Navigation
- H, J, K, L are used for navigation.
- w to move one word foward and lands at start of the word. e to move one word foward and lands at end of the word. b to move back. 5 + w to jump 5 words.
- gg to go to start of the file. SHIFT + G to go to end of a file.
- SHIFT + M to go to the middle section of visible screen.
  - SHIFT + M followed by ZZ can be used to scroll the document.
- Use [whichKey](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) plugin to know which next keys are available.

# Finding
- f followed by character to find. e.g. f + s finds the next s character we can hit ; to repeat it and go further , to go backward. Use F to search backward.
  - 4+f+s will find fourth occurance.
- To search for a word under our cursor press *.
- SHIFT+N to look for the previous match & N to go forward.
- Use % to move to matching pair of parantheses.

# Editing
- d + w deletes a word. But it cuts it so pressing p will paste it. SHIFT + P will paste previous. dd will delete the line.
- y + w yanks a word. yy will copy the line. p will paste below, SHIFT + P will paste above.
- CTRl + r to redo.
- Press CTRL+O in insert mode to run normal mode commands.
- d + i + w to delete in word and takes the entire word regardless of position. action + motion + range. E.g. d + i + p to delete in paragraph. y + i + p yank in paragraph.
- Install [text objects plugin](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function) to e.g. delete in function using d + i + f
- d + a + w to delete around word.
- c + i + ( change in parantheses. d + i + w to delete and cool thing is you don't have to be in the parantheses. Same works with ".
- From insert mode press Ctrl+O, 0 beginning of line, Ctrl+O, $ end of line
- CIW to change the word under cursor. Then press n to go to the next match and press .
- Another easier way to change all the occurrences of a word ```:%s/post/poops/g```, if we want confirmation before changing use ```:%s/post/poops/gc```
- VIW visually highlight a word and take any action, e.g. press Y to yank. Go somewhere else in the file and press P to paste it.
- To run any command from vim prefix it with ```:!<cmd>```
- CTRL+D and CTRL+U to scroll half the page.
- Un-commenting code:
  - Put your cursor on the first # character, press Ctrl + V, and go down until the last commented line and press x, that will delete all the # characters vertically.
- Commenting code:
  - First, go to the first line you want to comment, press Ctrl + V. This will put the editor in the VISUAL BLOCK mode.
  - Then using the arrow key and select until the last line
  - Now press Shift + I, which will put the editor in INSERT mode and then press #. This will add a hash to the first line.
  - Then press Esc (give it a second), and it will insert a # character on all other selected lines.

# Visual Mode
- Press v for visual mode and then press w, w it keeps selecting, until you press closing operator e.g. d to delete the selection.
- Press SHIFT + V t0 select the entire line. Press 6 + k to select 6 lines above, 6 + j to select 6 lines below and press d to delete. Or press 6 + D + K to do the same.
- CTRL + V to select a visual block. And followed by e.g. > to indent.

# Replace Mode
- SHIFT + R is replace mode.
  
# Registers
In case we yanked mltiple times we can see all those using ```:reg``` command. It shows all the registers and their contents. These regsiters have all the actions that we perform. So to paste from register 3 we press ```"3P```. Similarly we can yank into specific register using ```"7Y```

If we want to get the content of a register in Insert mode, we can press the **“Ctrl-r”** followed by the register’s name.

# Special Registers
Special registers do specific things. E.g. * register (in MAC) + register (in Linux) is the system clipboard. So if we copy something into this register, it allows us to copy things into other programs. So if we highlight a code block and press ```"+Y``` we copied things into + register.

we should keep in mind that Vim must be compiled with a +clipboard feature to support system clipboard access. Also, in order to use “* to talk to the X Windows selection, the +x11-selection feature should be enabled.

Only available if clipboard provider is available:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y xclip
```

% register always holds the name of the file you have currently open. So if we do ```"%p"``` we pasted the name of the file.

# Macros
So let's say we copied below data from somewhere and we want it to convert it into valid ruby array:

```
days =  [
  Monday
  Tuesday
  Wednesday
  Thursday
  Friday
  Saturday
  Sunday
]
```
For that we need to add quotes around each word and put comma. It will be a lot of work if we do it line by line. So using macro we can record and replay an action over and over. To start recording a macro we type ```q``` followed by the register we want to record into. e.g. ```qh``` will record the macro in register h. Now we perform the action on one line in such a way, so that it can we replayed. To replay recorded macro ```@h```. To apply the macro in next 5 lines ```5@h```
